# Colaboration
Step-by-step:
 1. Fork the repository
 2. At your terminal type `git checkout main` and then `git pull` to update your local branch.
 3. Check which week have passed since the beginning of the project. For that you can use [this website](https://planetcalc.com/7741/?date1=2022-03-19%2000%3A00%3A00) and change the **second date** to the today date.
 4. Then you can do `git checkout week_X` where **X** is the amount of weeks that have passed. If the branch doesn't exists you can do `git checkout -b week_X` and then `git push origin week_X` to add the branch to github. (*The week change every saturday*)
 5. Now we are at the week branch, we need to go to our feature branch. Do `git checkout feature_name` where **feature_name** is the feature you'll be working on (e.g. Loja, Fog, Movement). If the branch doesn't exists you can do `git checkout -b feature_name` and then `git push origin feature_name` to add the branch to github.
 6. Make the changes you wish üïπÔ∏èüíª
 7. When done do `git status` to see changes and `git add file_name` to add the file to the commit.
 8. When added all the changes to the commit do `git commit -m description_here` where **description_here** is a simples description of the changes.
 9. If sure about commit do `git push origin feature_name`.
 10. After pushing the change to github, open a new **pull request**.
