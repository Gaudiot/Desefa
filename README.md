# Colaboration
Step-by-step:
 1. Fork the repository
 2. At your terminal `checkout` to the *main* branch and `pull` any changes.
 3. Check how many weeks have passed since the beginning of the project. You can use [this website](https://planetcalc.com/7741/?date1=2022-03-19%2000%3A00%3A00) and change the **second date** to the today date. (*The week change every saturday*)
 4. `Checkout` to the *week_X* branch where **X** is  the amount of weeks that have passed (create branch if it doesn't exists and `push` it to github).
 5. Now from the *week_X* branch `checkout` to the *feature_name* branch. (e.g. timer, fog, movement_pawn) (create branch if it doesn't exists and `push` it to github)
 6. Make the changes you wish üïπÔ∏èüíª.
 7. When done `commit` the changes to your *feature_name* branch and `merge` it with *week_X* branch. (p.s. remember to commit with a descriptive message)
 8. When done making changes on *week_X* branch, `merge` it with the *main* branch.
 9. `Pull` to sync your repo with the original, then **solve the conflicts** if any. (if you don't know how to sync, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork))
 10. Open a `pull request` to merge your fork with the [original repo](https://github.com/Gaudiot/Desefa).
